### Show Notes

Recently I made my first podcast interview. I have appeared as a guest many times on different shows but this was the first time I was the interviewer. I am not afraid to admit that I had been avoiding doing one because it made me super anxious. But I also know that I'm telling you all to push the envelope of comfort to expand.

So I had to make myself do it otherwise it just makes me a hypocrite.

In this episode I share my thoughts, lessons learned and tips that I hope can help you, should you find yourself in a similar situation. Believe me, push through the fear and discover that it's way easier to do than you think once you get started.

I'd love to hear your thoughts, reach out to me at [peterwitham.com/contact](https://peterwitham.com/contact)
