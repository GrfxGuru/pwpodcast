### Show Notes

We live in a world with a short attention span by design. Social networks, for example, need you to scroll for them to make more money. Content makers get hurt by this because they get a few seconds of your attention at best.

Please slow down and appreciate the content they make. Here are my thoughts and hopes that you will consider.
