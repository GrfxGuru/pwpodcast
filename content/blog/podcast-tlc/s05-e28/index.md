### Show Notes

In this episode, I'll give an update on the video version of this podcast thanks to feedback from you the valued listeners.
I am also going to talk about managing historical content when it comes to migrating from one site to another, even when the domain name is the same. This is something everybody faces eventually if you have your own Web site.
