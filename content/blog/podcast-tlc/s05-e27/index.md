### Show Notes

In this midweek minute, I have a very tough question again for you to face for yourself. But a very worthwhile exercise if you are completely honest.

Pick something you find extremely difficult to do or face. Then make two lists, one for the reasons not to do it. Another for the reasons to break through the barrier and do it.

Then, see which list is the one you really feel is the best. Be honest!
