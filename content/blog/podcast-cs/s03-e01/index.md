### Show Notes

Apple's World Wide Developer Conference is always the highlight of the year for developers working with Apple platforms and tools. In this episode I have a very special guest, Leo Dion from the [EmpowerApps podcast](https://share.transistor.fm/s/ace13930). We discuss the announcements from the Keynote.

You should also listen to our State of the Union coverage where I join Leo on his [EmpowerApps episode](https://share.transistor.fm/s/ace13930).
