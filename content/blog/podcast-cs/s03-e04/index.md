### Show Notes

It was time for me to take a look at macOS Monterey. But as with every year, I install pre-release versions on an external drive. Which is normally not a problem. Until this year that is. The Apple M1 chip means I have to do things different and it is more complicated. I solved the problem and it might help you. So listen on.
