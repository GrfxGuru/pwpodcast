### Show Notes

In a recent live stream on [Twitch.tv/compileswift](Twitch.tv/compileswift) I was asked in the chatroom to give my thoughts on coding boot camps.

I answered the question during the stream, but I felt I should dive into the answer further in this episode and give more details. Youâ€™ll have to listen to hear my thoughts.
