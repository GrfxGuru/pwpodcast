### Show Notes

More than likely you have more than one view in your SwiftUI based application. If that is the case then you probably need to share data across those views and always have them displaying the latest data right? That's where the environment object comes into play, this makes it possible to do just that. I'll walk through the steps on how I recently implemented it in an application.

I will also be releasing a video soon, so if you are interested and want to know when that comes out head over to compileswift.com/contact and let me know.
